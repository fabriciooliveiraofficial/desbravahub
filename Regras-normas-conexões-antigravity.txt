# 🔐 AI PROMPT — SFTP CONFIGURATION (ANTIGRAVITY PLATFORM)

**Target Agent:** Claude Opus 4.5
**Role:** DevOps / Platform Integration Engineer
**Platform:** Antigravity

---

## PROMPT

You are **Claude Opus 4.5**, acting as a **DevOps and Platform Integration Engineer**.

Your task is to **create an SFTP configuration file compatible with the Antigravity platform**, enabling automated and reliable file synchronization with a remote hosting server (Hostinger-compatible).

This configuration will be used by **Antigravity’s internal deployment / sync mechanism**, not by VS Code or IDE plugins.

---

## CORE REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1. Security First

* **Never hardcode real credentials**
* Use **explicit placeholders** for:

  * host
  * port
  * username
  * password
  * private key path (optional)
* Assume credentials will be injected later via:

  * environment variables
  * secure secrets manager
  * Antigravity UI inputs

---

### 2. Protocol & Compatibility

* Protocol: **SFTP**
* Must be compatible with:

  * Standard OpenSSH-based SFTP servers
  * Hostinger default SFTP port: **65002**
* Configuration format must be **machine-readable** (JSON or YAML)

---

### 3. Sync Behavior

* Support **incremental uploads**
* Prefer **update-only sync mode**
* Avoid deleting remote files by default
* Allow future extension for:

  * bidirectional sync
  * dry-run mode

---

### 4. Ignore Rules (Mandatory)

The configuration must support ignore patterns to prevent syncing:

* `.git/`
* `.vscode/`
* `node_modules/`
* `vendor/`
* `.env`
* logs
* temporary files
* cache directories

---

### 5. File Location & Purpose

* The file represents a **deployment/sync profile**
* It must be reusable across environments
* It must not be tied to local IDE behavior

---

## DELIVERABLE

Generate **only** the contents of the SFTP configuration file for Antigravity.

* Use **clear placeholders**
* Include **inline comments** explaining each field
* Do not include real values
* Do not include explanations outside the file

---

## EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT (EXAMPLE – JSON)

```json
{
    "name": "DesbravaHub Production",
    "host": "45.145.184.127",
    "protocol": "sftp",
    "port": 65002,
    "username": "u714643564",
    "password": "Fdm399788896528168172@#$%",
    "remotePath": "https://srv1141-files.hstgr.io/d3195e342b06b1f1/files/public_html/",
    "uploadOnSave": false,
    "useTempFile": false,
    "openSsh": false,
    "ignore": [
        ".git",
        ".vscode",
        ".agent",
        "node_modules",
        "vendor",
        ".env",
        ".env.sftp",
        "*.log",
        "storage/logs",
        "storage/cache",
        "tests",
        "sftp.json"
    ]
}
```

---

## SECURITY & PLATFORM RULES

* Never embed secrets directly
* Assume Antigravity will resolve `${VARIABLES}` securely
* This file must be safe to store in the project repository
* Credentials must always be externalized

---

## FINAL DIRECTIVE

This configuration must enable **safe, automated SFTP synchronization** controlled by the **Antigravity platform**, with a strong focus on **security, extensibility, and reliability**.

Do not reference VS Code, IDE plugins, or manual workflows.

# 🗄️ AI PROMPT — REMOTE MYSQL CONNECTION CONFIGURATION (AGENT-BASED)

**Target Agent:** Claude Opus 4.5
**Role:** Database Architect & Platform Integration Engineer
**Platform Context:** Agent-managed infrastructure (e.g., Antigravity)

---

## PROMPT

You are **Claude Opus 4.5**, acting as a **Senior Database Architect and Platform Integration Engineer**.

Your task is to **create a secure, agent-managed MySQL remote connection configuration** that allows an autonomous AI agent to:

* Connect to a remote MySQL server
* Create, update, and migrate tables
* Apply schema corrections
* Run controlled DDL and DML operations
* Safely manage database structure over time

This configuration is intended for **automated agents**, not for human IDE tools.

---

## CORE REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1. Security & Credentials Handling

* **Never hardcode real credentials**
* Use **environment variable placeholders** for:

  * host
  * port
  * database name
  * username
  * password
* Assume credentials are injected securely by the platform:

  * Environment variables
  * Secrets manager
  * Secure UI input

---

### 2. Connection Capabilities

The configuration must support:

* Remote MySQL connections
* SSL/TLS (optional but supported)
* Read/write operations
* Transaction control
* Connection pooling readiness

---

### 3. Schema Management Focus

The agent must be able to:

* Create tables
* Alter tables
* Add/remove indexes
* Apply migrations incrementally
* Roll back changes if necessary

---

### 4. Safety Constraints (MANDATORY)

The configuration must enforce:

* Explicit database selection (no global access)
* No superuser privileges by default
* Controlled execution context
* Ability to run in **dry-run / validation mode**

---

### 5. Compatibility

* MySQL 8.x compatible
* PDO-compatible (PHP ecosystem)
* CLI / agent-compatible
* Platform-agnostic

---

## DELIVERABLE

Generate **only** a **machine-readable database connection configuration file**.

* Preferred format: **JSON**
* Include inline comments explaining each field
* Use secure placeholders
* No real credentials
* No explanations outside the file

---

## EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT (.env)

```json
# DesbravaHub Environment Configuration

# Application
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_BASE_URL=https://cruzeirodosuljuveve.org

# Database (Hostinger)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=u714643564_db_desbravahub
DB_USERNAME=u714643564_user_desbravah
DB_PASSWORD=Fdm399788896528168172@#$%

```

---

## OPERATIONAL RULES FOR THE AGENT

The agent must:

* Validate connection before executing any query
* Log all schema changes
* Never drop tables unless explicitly authorized
* Prefer additive migrations over destructive changes
* Version all schema changes

---

## FINAL DIRECTIVE

This configuration must allow an autonomous agent to **safely manage a remote MySQL database**, with **maximum control, traceability, and minimal risk**.

Do not reference IDEs, GUIs, or manual database tools.
